# Using Singularity on Farmshare 2

FarmShare 2 supports running Singularity containers, either those you download or those you create somewhere else.

Unfortunately, we don't have much informaton on Singularity right now, but we'd like to give you something! So, here are two links for you to get started:

### Current Documentation

 * [Singularity 3.1](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.1/user-guide/)
 * [Singularity 3.0](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/)

### Deprecated Pages 

These pages are deprecated, but still useful to some degree for 2.x versions of Singularity:

 * [Singularity Home Page](http://singularity.lbl.gov)
 * [Singularity Quick Start](http://singularity.lbl.gov/quickstart)

FarmShare 2 already has Singularity installed as a package, so it is not necessary for you to install it yourself. We also do not support any of the container management commands (because those need to be run as root). We *do* support running already-built containers!
