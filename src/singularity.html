<h1>Using Singularity on Farmshare 2</h1>
<p class="summary">FarmShare 2 supports running Singularity containers, either those you download or those you create somewhere else.</p>
<!---break--->
<p>Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have much informaton on Singularity right now, but we&#39;d like to give you something! &nbsp;So, here are two links for you to get started:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://singularity.lbl.gov">Singularity Home Page</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://singularity.lbl.gov/quickstart">Singularity Quick Start</a></li>
</ul>
<p>FarmShare 2 already has Singularity installed as a package, so it is not necessary for you to install it yourself. &nbsp;We also do not support any of the container management commands (because those need to be run as root). &nbsp;We&nbsp;<em>do</em> support running already-built containers!</p>
